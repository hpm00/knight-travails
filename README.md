# knight-travails
Ruby Project from theOdinProject

Something to work on:

I tried to use a recursion for my knight_moves method. I ultimately failed to because my first line of code in the method transforms the start position into a 'starting' node. My recursion seemed to run into errors because I couldn't make a node out of something that is already a node. I would like to modify my method in some way in order to use recursion rather than a until loop. 

Something I learned:

I knew exactly what I wanted to do just from my pseudocode; however, I was running into some issues with my code at first. I realized I knew I needed to implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, so I began writing my code as if I was traversing through a binary tree. Once I wrote the 'backbone' code, I was then able to modify it to my particular task.
