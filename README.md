# knight-travails
Ruby Project from theOdinProject

Something to work on:

I tried to use a recursion for my knight_moves method. I ultimately failed to because my first line of code in the method transforms the start position into a 'starting' node. My recursion seemed to run into errors because I couldn't make a node out of something that is already beginning as a node. I would like to modify my method in some way in order to use recursion rather than a until loop.
